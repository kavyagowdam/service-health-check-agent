# service-health-check-agent


## Simple Service Health Checker Agent
```
Concept: Develop a small Go service that runs periodically (or listens on an endpoint) to check the health of specified services (HTTP endpoints, TCP ports, perhaps even database connections). It could log the status or expose a simple status page.
```
DevOps Relevance: Monitoring and health checks are critical. This project teaches you how to build a resilient background service in Go.
### Core Go Concepts/Libraries:
    Concurrency (goroutines and channels) for checking multiple services simultaneously.
    net/http: For making HTTP requests.
    net: For TCP port checks.
    time: For scheduling checks.
    Logging (log or a structured logging library like zap or logrus).
    Configuration management (reading service URLs from a file or environment variables).
    Optional: Building a simple HTTP server (net/http) to expose status.
### Potential Features/Extensions:
    Configure checks from a YAML/JSON file.
    Implement different check types (HTTP, TCP, Ping, DNS).
    Add alerting (send to Slack, PagerDuty API - more advanced).
    Expose metrics in Prometheus format (prometheus/client_golang).
### Run it as a Deployment or DaemonSet in Kubernetes.
Kubernetes Involvement: Can be easily containerized and run within Kubernetes, monitoring services inside or outside the cluster.

Complexity: Intermediate. Introduces concurrency and building a long-running service.
